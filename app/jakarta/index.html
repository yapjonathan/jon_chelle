      <h3>Jakarta Event</h3>
      <p class="lead">💍 Overview 💍</p>
      <p>Event in Jakarta is a full church holy matrimony at 12 PM and a evening reception at 7 PM. We have written <a href="/update/2015/05/04/our-day-in-jakarta/">a post about Jakarta event</a> previously, so head over to get a full overview. For the specific event location and time, more info down below. Just keep scrolling, we've even throw in a map for you!</p>

      <p class="lead">👔 Dress code 👗</p>
      <p>Church ceremony is pretty straight forward, be respectful, come <b>smart and dress conservatively</b>.</p>
      <p>Evening reception is a little less formal, but more playful and fun tailored to our style. Dress fun but <b>dress smart formal</b>. People in Jakarta tend to come to WOW when they show up for these parties. We have a photo booth set up so dress to have your photos taken!</p>

       <p class="lead">💵 Ang Pao / Gift registry 🎁</p>
       <p>Traditionally within our culture, we didn't practice much of the gift registry part but instead, we do the 'Ang Pao' (translated as red packet in Hokkien/Teochew) as a token which consist of cash. It's a more practical approach for us since we are travelling light. Gifts are still welcomed, but keep it small and light.</p>
       <p>Feel free to give in any currency you want, but keeping it local will be easier for us to handle. Just ask during the <b>Evening reception</b> where to drop it, we should have an dedicated spot prepared. For those who travel to 2 receptions, feel free to give in anyway you want, split it in 2 sides or drop all of them in 1. No pressure for everyone! 😁</p>
