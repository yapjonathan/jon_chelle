## Travel Tips in Jakarta

Jakarta can be a fun and interesting place to travel, so we like to share a little knowledge to travel around will keep you happy and healthy through out your trip.

<span class="lead">Getting around</span>

Welcome to one of the world's most congested city in the world, there are about 10 million people in Jakarat itself but [estimate](http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/09/27/jakarta-embrace-12-million-vehicles-2011.html) about 12 million vechiles on the road! The average time getting stuck in traffic can be up to 2 hours on a bad day.

To save you the headache of travelling around yourself, hop on a taxi to get you around town. There are many taxis around but the only trusted and vetted service are from the blue bird group. Blue bird taxi (or the slightly upper market Silver Bird) is the most reliable and safe taxi vendors around, so it's good to keep their app on your phone when you need to book a taxi. Look for the Blue Bird logo when you hail a taxi or head over to their online site for [more info](http://www.bluebirdgroup.com/online-reservation). We don't recommend the rest because some will take advantage of you if you are not familiar or a local.

Alternatively, Uber can be a good choice too to get around. If you are a first time uber user, [here's a $10 credit](https://www.uber.com/invite/ai6jh) for you to jump start.

GrabCar from GrabTaxi (or MyTeksi) is also a good way to get around, all access from your phone. [Grab a $8](https://invite.grabtaxi.com/97830C) off for your first ride!

<span class="lead">Food & Drinks</span>

Indonesia has one of the most amazing variety of asian food you'll ever come across in South East Asia. If you enjoy taking your tastebud on an adventure, it's a great place to sample the tantalising flavours. Having said that, there are some tips to keep you safe too!

**Water** – The water here isn't the cleanest, so if you are used to drinking from the tap, **please do not** do so here. There are cases where people get sick from it, not even boiling them will help too much. Best get plenty of bottled water from the nearest store, it plentiful and affordable.

**Street food** – For street food, it is only recommended to do so if you have an iron stomach. Some street stalls aren't known for their hygeine, so it might be a little worrisome for someone who has a weak stomach. If you have been travelling and have a strong stomach, you might find yourself savouring one of the tastiest and cheapest treats around (albeit not the healthiest… but who cares? You're on a holiday). There are plenty of fantastic places to try some really intereting food, shops, cafe, and restaurant are all safe bets. Even though they are in shops, they aren't too bad of a price as well.
