It will be a 1.5 - 2 hours church service where we would exchange vows and be introduced as husband and wife for the first time. The ceremony is usually attended by immediate family but everyone are very much welcomed to attend.</p><p>Soon to follow, the evening reception will be where we hope to meet all of our invitees. It will be a wonderful celebration and a reunion with friends and family! The venue will be a semi-outdoor location facing the Java sea.</p><p>Be prepared for lots of food, mingling, dancing, laughters, fun and love! As you enter our reception area, please sign in with your names at our welcome area right at the entrance. A couple friendly ladies will welcome you, gracefully accept your &quot;red packets&quot; (more on this later) and drop them into the boxes provided.</p><p>The reception party will be a standing party with an array of buffet foods for your tummy. So there&#39;s no need to pick a seat, just mingle! You might meet someone you know or even make a new friend.</p><p>We are always thankful of the kind and generous wedding gifts and gestures, and your presence is already very much appreciated. But if you&#39;d like to give us gifts, we&#39;d be grateful if you could take note of our somewhat nomad lifestyles. We&#39;re always moving around! :D</p><p>Usually in a Chinese wedding tradition, guests will instead offer an &quot;Red Packet&quot; or more formally known as &quot;Ang Pao&quot;. It is a little red envelope that includes some money inside, comparable to the Western style wedding registry.</p><p>If you do decide to give us gifts in the form of money, please refrain from storing it in a white envelope as in Chinese tradition white envelopes are used in sad and sombre occasions. Red colour on the other is known as an auspicious colour to represent well wishes, blessings and good luck. If you do not have a red envelope, you can ask the ladies in the welcome area for one!</p><p>Your attendance is the greatest gift of all. So no matter what, you know we are eternally grateful! ðŸ’–</p><p>We hope this will give you a little idea of our culture and what&#39;s happening on that special day, and we can&#39;t wait to see you then!</p></div></article><footer class=footer><p>Made with <span class=heart>&hearts;</span> #JonChelle2015</p></footer></div></div><script src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/_bower_components/jquery/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script><script src=/js/script.92d1.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
